# Sudoku Solver

A Python application that automatically captures, processes, and solves Sudoku puzzles. The application uses computer vision to detect Sudoku grids from screenshots, OCR to extract numbers, and a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles.

## Features

- Screen capture and image cropping functionality
- Automatic Sudoku grid detection and extraction
- OCR-based number recognition
- Efficient Sudoku solving algorithm
- User-friendly GUI with color coding for original vs. solved values
- Manual editing capabilities for OCR correction

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, PyAutoGUI, Pytesseract, Pillow

### Dependencies Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tesseract OCR Setup

This application uses Tesseract OCR for digit recognition. You need to install it separately:

#### Windows
1. Download and install Tesseract from [https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
2. Add the Tesseract installation directory to your system PATH

#### macOS
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python sudoku_solver.py
```

2. Click the "Capture & Extract" button to take a screenshot
3. Select the Sudoku grid region by dragging with your mouse
4. Check and correct any digits that were incorrectly recognized
5. Click "Solve" to solve the Sudoku puzzle

## How It Works

### Capture and Extraction
- Takes a screenshot of your screen
- Allows you to select the Sudoku grid
- Uses contour detection to identify and extract the grid
- Applies perspective transformation to obtain a straight view

### Number Recognition
- Divides the grid into 81 cells
- Uses Tesseract OCR to recognize digits in each cell
- Fills the Sudoku grid with recognized numbers

### Solving Algorithm
- Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle
- Checks for valid placements of digits according to Sudoku rules
- Finds a complete, valid solution if one exists
